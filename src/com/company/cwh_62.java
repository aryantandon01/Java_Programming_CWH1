//        Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole code into machine code
//        After a compiled language code is compiled, a compiler is not needed whereas an interpreter is always needed to execute the code
//        Partial execution of code occurs if an interpreter finds an error whereas no part of code executes in a compiler if it finds an error
//        Java is a hybrid language (compiled and interpreted ka mixture)
